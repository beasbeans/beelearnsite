# bee-learn

A coding project for Academic Team made by Bea

<h1>https://bee-learn.herokuapp.com/set</h1>

Using data pulled from the immortal LUKE_KNULL's quizlets, bee-learn produces randomized question sets for use in NAQT practices.

limitations:
  no lightning round or alphabet round data
  not very nice to look at
  can only generate sets
  
 future plans:
  improve html, add css (none yet lol)
  add more user interactibility (text response, flash card mode)
